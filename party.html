									<h3>Leia Hannum</h3>
									<h5>They/Them</h5>
									<h5>Maid of Honor</h5>
									<p>Howdy y'all! I'm Leia — the Texas transplant who traded cowboy boots for concrete jungles, now living it up in New York City! It all started in college, with a meeting through a mutual friend. Maria and I hit it off immediately, bonding over our shared love for writing, our queerness, and of course, a healthy dose of tomfoolery. Late nights with Maria and Mel were spent crafting typewriter poetry, fueling our brains over cups of joe at Cafe Brazil, or indulging in frozen yogurt runs that always seemed to end in fits of laughter. Together, we delved into the worlds of Dungeons & Dragons, navigated the ups and downs of English classes, and joined forces in queer organizing on campus! To witness the love between Maria and Mel is truly something special.  I am beyond honored to be a part of their journey and celebrate their lifelong commitment to each other this September. Cheers to love!</p>

									<h3>Sabah Shams</h3>
									<h5>They/Them</h5>
									<h5>Bridesmate</h5>
									<p>Sabah is an artist and plant lover who met the happy couple as they all were just stepping into adolescence, barely real people. Currently based in Boston, Sabah seeks to pursue a life of art that is both joyous and meaningful. In their spare time, they love taking their rescue pup on hikes or curling up with a good book. Sabah has been waiting (im)patiently for this wedding for over a decade and has not been able to shut up about it since the date was set. </p>

									<h3>Palmer Beldy</h3>
									<h5>She/Her</h5>
									<h5>Bridesmaid</h5>
									<p>Hey party people! Love this couple, love these people, and love, love, love being apart of THE wedding party!

										A little bit about me — Originally from all over California, then went to high school in Kentucky! Found my way to Dallas, Texas (thank goodness, am I right) where I studied Creative Advertising and Public Relations and graduated in May of 2022. Maria and I are writers adjacent — I am a copywriter, so I do work with nonprofits and agencies with branding and communication strategy. Currently, I have the most fun job in the world — teaching second grade math and going to grad school in DC through Teach For America. Gooooo Whales! 
										
										A little bit about Maria, Mel, and me — Maria and I met each other through the Hegi Career Center at SMU, where we worked as peer mentors (they upgraded our title to career consultant our last year, but peer mentor just feels right). We were always working and helping people with their resumes, and we were talking, joking around, and becoming very true, best friends even more. We then found ourselves connected through different work at SMU, but shifts together were treasured amidst the busyness of it all. Then, had the HONOR of meeting Mel throughout that time — lunch and dinner dates, visits to the office, and bonding over our shared Alpha Chi sisterhood. 
										
										Cannot wait to boogie and celebrate with everyone so soon!</p>

									<h3>Caroline Roman</h3>
									<h5>She/Her</h5>
									<h5>Bridesmaid</h5>
									<p>Congrats to M&M!!! I met Maria at SMU in 2020 upon finding ourselves in quite a few Zoom classes together. It turns out we shared both a love of creative writing and the French language. I later got to meet them and Mel in person, where we all fostered a lovely friendship involving parties, lake trips, D&D, baking and more! I'm honored to be a part of their wedding party and so very excited to celebrate them. When I'm not pursuing my highest calling as one of M&M's bridesmaids, I reside in Dallas, TX where I work as a paralegal.</p>
