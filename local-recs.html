							<h2>Local Recommendations</h2>
							<p>We're so excited to get to share Evanston with some of our out-of-town friends and family! We've listed some of our favorite resturaunts, coffee shops, and experiences in the city and encourage you to explore on your own with any time before the wedding.</p>

											<h3>Dining</h3>
											<strong>Firehouse Grill</strong><br>
											750 Chicago Ave, Evanston, IL 60202<br>
											A restored firehouse from the early 1900s, Firehouse Grill is bursting with charm and good eats. We go there every week for trivia, and it’s always reliable for a yummy meal! Mel has tried many dishes and liked them all, but her favorite is the veggie quesadilla with chicken. Maria, on the other hand, gets the chicken caesar salad wrap with fries every week without fail and loves it every single time. Save room for the cookie skillet!</p>

											<strong>Egg Harbor Café</strong><br> 
											1701 Maple Ave, Evanston, IL 60201<br>
											This casual brunch spot is newer to the Evanston area, but it’s already Mel & Maria approved – we love taking out-of-towners for a delicious breakfast! You can’t go wrong with anything on this menu; Maria normally goes for a French toast, while Mel likes the Buenos Dias Bagelwich. We also love the craft coffees!</p> 

											<strong>Evanston Pour and Sea Ranch Sushi</strong><br> 
											528 Dempster St, Evanston, IL 60202 and 518 Dempster St, Evanston, IL 60202<br>
											Evanston Pour is another favorite coffee shop! We both love the hot teas here and particularly enjoy the “in-house tea service” option. Pour also serves wine, beer, and craft cocktails, and is open ‘late’ (at least, for Evanston!) – until 9 PM most days.<br>
											If you get hungry, Pour does have some tasty snacks, but we recommend ordering Sea Ranch sushi – the hole-in-the-wall spot next door will deliver directly to your table at Pour! Maria always gets the North Sea roll (salmon and avocado) and Mel gets the South Sea roll (tuna and avocado). We also LOVE their miso soup!!</p>

											<strong>Hoosier Mama Pie Company</strong><br> 
											749 Chicago Ave, Evanston, IL 60202<br>
											Hoosier Mama offers both sweet and savory pies, and it’s another one of our favorites for out-of-town guests! Their pie menu changes daily, but Maria has loved the Earl Grey flavor, as well as all the pumpkin variations that appear in the autumn. Mel has always been a chess pie fan, and this is one of the best places to get it outside of the South!</p>

											<strong>Siam Paragon</strong><br> 
											503 Main St, Evanston, IL 60202<br>
											Another great spot for lunch or dinner! Siam Paragon offers all the standard Thai dishes, as well as more pan-Asian fusion food, curries, and sushi! Maria’s favorite is the pad see ew, and Mel loves the pad thai. Their lunch deals are also delicious, affordable, and LARGE – you’ll have leftovers for sure! </p>

											<h3>Drinks</h3>
											<strong>Colectivo Coffee</strong><br> 
											716 Church St, Evanston, IL 60201<br>
											This coffee shop is across the street from the Hilton Orrington and just a few blocks away from Northwestern University, which makes it one of Maria’s go-to’s while on campus. She particularly enjoys the London Fog (formerly known as the Windy Ci-Tea) and the lemonade Sportea Lifter. Mel’s favorites include an iced Chai and their pumpkin cranberry muffins. If the weather is nice, enjoy the patio outside!</p>

											<strong>Sketchbook Brewing Company</strong><br> 
											821 Chicago Ave, Evanston, IL 60202<br>
											Sketchbook is another weekly favorite of ours – some of the History PhDs and our +1s hang out there every Friday! They have a great selection of beers and ciders from their own brewery. Mel’s the beer expert, and her favorites include the Catharina Fruited Sour and the Bud's Corvus Nitro. There's not a bad beer on the wall - make sure to check and see what $5 pint specials they have this month!</p>

											<strong>Reprise Coffee Roasters</strong><br> 
											710 Main St, Evanston, IL 60202<br>
											Reprise is another great coffee shop – they’ve also recently opened a location in the Northwestern library! Maria loves their London Fog and usually orders an off-menu Arnold Palmer. Mel usually gets a hot tea; their Cascara tea is award winning! Their snacks are also great, and they always have dairy-free and gluten-free baked goods.</p>

											<h3>Experiences</h3>
											<strong>Evanston Farmer's Market</strong><br>
											1800 Maple Ave, Evanston, IL 60201<br>
											If you're in town by Saturday morning, we highly recommend stopping by the Farmer's Market (directly behind the Hilton Garden Inn) for fresh fruits, vegetables, and baked goods. Everything is brought in from surrounding farms and is a great showcase of the best food in the North Shore! Our favorite stalls for a quick breakfast include Katic Breads, Gotta B Crepes, and Sheekar Delights.</p>
